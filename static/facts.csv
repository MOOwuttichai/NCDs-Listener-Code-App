"Mandibular measurements of the lower second molar (MD33 and MD43) were used to predict the probability of a cast being female. Adding MD33 to MD43 significantly improved model performance (χ² = 5.627, p = 0.018) and increased the AUC from 0.900 to 0.918, though classification accuracy remained 85.8%. Lower MD33 and MD43 values were linked to a higher probability of being female."
Gonial Angle: Females have a larger gonial angle compared to males.
Ramus Height: Males exhibit a greater ramus height than females.
Bigonial Width: Males have a larger bigonial width than females.
Age Trends (Ramus Height): Ramus height decreases steadily in the 5th and 6th decades of life.
"Age Trends (Gonial Angle): The gonial angle increases with age, significantly between younger and older age groups."
Measurement Tools: Panoramic radiographs are effective for measuring mandibular parameters like the gonial angle.
Orthodontic Use: Gonial angle measurements assist in diagnosing growth patterns and planning orthodontic treatments.
Forensic Relevance: Gonial angle and other mandibular parameters help in forensic identification of age and gender.
Developmental stages of third molars are more accurate for age estimation than measurements.
Measurements like tooth length and width were less effective.
Gleiser and Hunt studies showed that Males showed higher accuracy (R² 0.85) compared to females (R² 0.77).
Gleiser and Hunt studies showed that Combining measurements with staging didn’t provide significant benefits.
